In today's scrum we all agreed that we weren't 100% on HTML border structure. We all felt that after the test, we looked over the information and 
grabbed a better understanding. The rest of the day was spent on JAVA. We had a few excellent lectures from Mike. We had three projecters for the 
remainder of the day. Two of them involved calculating someones pay based on the hours worked and pay rate. The last project was to great a 
'Choose Your Adventure' type story. This was not only challenging, but was also a blast. After class today I plan on adding some finishing touches and 
uploading it to github. I am excited for tomorrow, where we will be diving deeper into JAVA.
