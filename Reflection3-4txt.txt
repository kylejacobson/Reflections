Today we Started off with a lecture on Java functions, classes, objects and instantiation.
All of this was new information to me, and it was a lot to take in. Our project was to add multiple classes and 
objects to our story. I was having a diffiuclt time with this. I asked Adam to do a run thru on the white board
and I was able to get a little bit of a better grasp. This weekend I plan to watch some more tutorial videos to 
try and get a full understanding of what I'm working with.
