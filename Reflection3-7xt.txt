We stared today off with a lecture on Java loops and inheritance. It was then followed by two projects. The first was to make a for loop
that counted off every number from 1-100. It had 3 conditions, if the number was divisible by 4 have it print "fizz". If it was 
divisible by 7, print "buzz". The last condition was if it is divisible by both 7 and 4, print "fuzzbuzz". Our second project
was to make a robot using inheritance. The requirements were to have it move and be able to recharge. Starting off, I had a very
difficult time with this project. I sat down with Adam several times and I was able to have a few things cleared up.
