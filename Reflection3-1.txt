Today we started out with a team scrum. We talked about what we learned the previous 
day,and what we were going to accomplish today. We got into basic networking
and how it might become useful with programming. Before lunch, we created 
.bat files and played around with how they can do things using the command line.
After lunch, Nick lectured about HTML & CSS. We then created our own web page and
uploaded it to github. I spent the rest of the day messing around with my page and
doing HTML/CSS tutorials on codeacademy.
