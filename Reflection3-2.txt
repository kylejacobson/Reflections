Today was a pretty good day. We started out with our usual scrum. After, we continued on with our HTML/CSS files.
After a bit of time, I felt much more confident about building my web page. The next thing we had was a lecture
on internet infrastructures and googling. We then went to a projected where we had to use Google to find 
specific answers to questions. After that we had our first exam. I felt confident for the most part, except for
some of the HTML syntax. After we finished our exam we went next door to do more practicing with Google.
I feel very confident using Google! After finishing the research questions I dove into the Java tutorial 
on CodeAcademy.
