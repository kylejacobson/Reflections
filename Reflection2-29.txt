Today we started out learning bianary numbers. We then went into an activity where we converted from decimal notation to hexidecimal, octidecimal, and into bianary.
We then listen to a lecture about Github, which seems to be a very helpful tool. We broke out into groups and all collaborated on a story.
The biggest problem we ran into was everyone trying to push their changes to the story without pulling any of the new additions.
This issue helped us work on communicating with each other better.
